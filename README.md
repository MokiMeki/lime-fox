# lime-fox

Download SDK at [Cooler Master Website](http://www.coolermaster.com/peripheral/keyboards/masterkeys-pro-s/)

Then copy :
```
SDKDLL.lib, SDKDLL.h -> /lime-fox/CMSDK/

SDKDLL.dll -> /lime-fox and any where your execution file will go.
```
and... you're good to go!

ps. lime-fox is experimental and intended to work only on masterkeys-pro-s rgb. 

If used on other cm-keyboard it's may require a little tweak.
